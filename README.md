# quicKM

[**quicKM**](http://quickm.org) is an online application offering **rapid and user-friendly analysis** of **pre-curated open-access RNA sequencing data** and corresponding **clinical case files**.

The quicKM **survival analysis plotting tool** is able to establish the correlation between expression of **over 30,000 genes** and patient survival across the **"big four" cancers**, including **breast**, **prostate**, **lung** and **colon cancer**. The primary purpose of the tool is a meta-analysis based **discovery and validation of survival biomarkers**.

quicKM can calculate an integrated expression value for multiple input genes prior to running survival analysis, making it possible to **establish the prognostic value of gene and cell-type signatures or entire pathways**.

**Tools offered by quicKM:**

- Easy **filtration of clinical case data** by common parameters
- Dynamic and **interactive graphical plotting** of patient cohort composition
- Interactive **Kaplan-Meier analysis** for both **single genes** and **gene signatures**
- Fully **downloadable data files** at each stage of analysis
